# RF Spectrum Interference Calculator

A professional-grade tool for analyzing RF spectrum interference, harmonics, and intermodulation products across global wireless bands.

## üöÄ Features
- **Comprehensive Band Support**: 76+ bands including 3GPP LTE 1-71, Wi-Fi 2.4G/5G/6E, Bluetooth LE, ISM, HaLow, LoRaWAN, GNSS
- **Professional IMD Analysis**: Complete coverage including IM2 beat terms, IM3, IM4, IM5, IM7 with all edge cases
- **Extended Harmonic Products**: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th harmonic analysis (2H-5H)
- **IM2 Beat Terms**: Critical f‚ÇÅ ¬± f‚ÇÇ analysis often higher than IM3 in wideband systems  
- **Risk Assessment**: Signal-level based prioritization (2H > IM2 > 3H > IM3 > 4H > IM4 > 5H > IM5 > IM7)
- **Smart Deduplication**: Eliminates mathematical duplicates for concise results
- **Overlap Detection**: Real-time Tx/Rx overlap warnings and alerts
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 4-tab chart system with frequency spectrum plots, risk analysis, band coverage, and product distribution
- **Professional Export**: CSV, Excel (multi-sheet), JSON formats with timestamped filenames
- **Advanced Filtering**: Category-based filtering, frequency range limits, risk-based sorting
- **Modern UI**: Streamlit interface with enhanced configuration options and presets
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation (`bands.py`, `calculator.py`, `ui.py`)

## üî¨ Analysis Types
- **Harmonics (2H-5H)**: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th harmonic products
- **IM2 Beat Terms**: Critical f‚ÇÅ ¬± f‚ÇÇ beat frequencies (often higher than IM3)
- **IM3**: Third-order intermodulation with fundamental and harmonic mixing  
- **IM4**: Fourth-order products (2f‚ÇÅ + 2f‚ÇÇ, 3f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ, f‚ÇÅ + 3f‚ÇÇ)
- **IM5**: Fifth-order products (3f‚ÇÅ ¬± 2f‚ÇÇ, 2f‚ÇÅ ¬± 3f‚ÇÇ)
- **IM7**: Seventh-order intermodulation products (4f‚ÇÅ ¬± 3f‚ÇÇ)
- **ACLR**: Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio analysis

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
