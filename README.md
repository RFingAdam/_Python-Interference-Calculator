## 🔍 Critical Interference Examples

### 1. GPS Safety Risk
![LTE B13 → GPS L1](screenshots/lte_b13_2h_gps_l1.png)
**LTE Band 13** (777-787 MHz) **→ GPS L1** (1575 MHz)  
- **Product**: 2nd Harmonic @ 1574 MHz 🔴  
- **Impact**: GPS navigation interference
- **Formula**: `2×787 MHz = 1574 MHz` (exactly hits GPS L1 at 1575.42 MHz)

### 2. Wi-Fi 5G Performance Impact

## 📊 Interactive Analysis Features

The application provides four comprehensive analysis views (shown above for LTE B4 → Wi-Fi 5G scenario):

### Four Analysis Views:
- **🎯 Frequency Spectrum**: Interactive scatter plot showing all interference products positioned by frequency and risk level
- **📈 Risk Analysis**: Pie chart showing severity distribution with color-coded risk categories and critical product counts  
- **🔍 Band Coverage**: Visual frequency allocation chart displaying transmit/receive band relationships and overlaps
- **⚡ Product Distribution**: Histogram showing frequency distribution of interference products with risk-based coloring

Each view provides different insights:
- **Spectrum view**: Identifies exact interference frequencies and victim bands
- **Risk view**: Prioritizes critical products requiring immediate attention  
- **Coverage view**: Shows band relationships and potential conflicts
- **Distribution view**: Reveals interference concentration across frequency ranges
